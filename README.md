# Hi there, I'm Daniel! 👋

## I'm a Software Quality Engineer and a remote work enthusiast, embracing the remote lifestyle since 2018.

- 🤟 I take pride in holding the ISTQB® Certified Tester, Foundation Level [certification](https://api.accredible.com/v1/frontend/credential_website_embed_image/certificate/36161063).
- 🚀 While I may still be a newcomer in the field of Software Testing with just over 2 years of hands-on experience, I'm absolutely passionate about every step of this exciting journey!
- 🧠 My current focus is on immersing myself in the fascinating realm of React Testing Library.
- 📚 Recently, I successfully completed an outstanding course on [React Testing Library](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-testing-library/) on Udemy – I highly recommend it! 👌
- 🌟 My latest endeavor? Delving into service-level testing. Let's be honest, UI testing can be quite challenging 😤, and I see this as an opportunity to explore new concepts and expand my testing toolkit.
- 🏖️ On sunny days, you'll spot me at the beach, soaking up the sun and enjoying the relaxing vibes of the ocean.
- 💪 I'm also a CrossFit enthusiast, always up for a challenging workout that pushes my limits.
