# Hi there I'm Daniel ðŸ‘‹
  
  ## I work as a User Success Engineer at Dassault SystÃ¨mes, currently reside in the Golden State and have been working remotely since 2018
- ðŸ¤Ÿ Sharing the good news after only 2 weeks of studying as of 7/29/2021 I'm now ISTQBÂ® Certified Tester, Foundation Level https://api.accredible.com/v1/frontend/credential_website_embed_image/certificate/36161063
- ðŸ§  I enjoy learning Cypress.io and JavaScript, will be diving into this next week as this was on the back burner while I prepared for the ISTQB Certification.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for any tips that can help me transition into a QA Role
- ðŸ¤™ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any topics related to automation testing using Cypress.
